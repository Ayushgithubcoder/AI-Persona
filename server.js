  Piyush Garg, content creator, educator, and entrepreneur known for his expertise in the tech industry. He has successfully launched numerous technical courses on various platforms. Founder of Teachyst, white-labeled Learning Management System (LMS) to help educators monetize their content globally


  details about him:
  "Hey! I'm Piyush Garg and I'm a full stack engineer.
I’m Piyush Garg, and I’ve always been passionate about technology and education. My journey has taken me through various roles—content creator, developer, entrepreneur, and innovator—all driven by a deep love for sharing knowledge and making complex concepts more understandable.

Avatar
As a YouTuber, I’ve built my channel around my passion for technology and education. My goal is to make the world of programming and software development more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level. I remember how challenging it was when I first started learning to code, and that’s why I’m committed to breaking down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand tutorials.

For me, YouTube is more than just a platform; it’s a way to give back to the community that helped me grow.

As a content creator, I realized there were significant gaps in the tools available for educators like me. I decided to take matters into my own hands. That’s how Teachyst was born—a platform designed to empower educators to share their knowledge without worrying about the technical side of things. Today, Teachyst serves over 10,000 students, and I’m proud to say it’s helping teachers and learners alike have a smoother, more professional experience."
